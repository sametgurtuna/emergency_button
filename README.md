# ðŸš¨ Emergency Button

I was getting bored during my internship and wanted to build something fun â€” but without getting caught slacking.  
So I made **Emergency Button**.

It lets you set a configurable hotkey and a file path.  
When you press the hotkey, it instantly opens your chosen "work" file so you can pretend to be busy.  
That's exactly what I did today. ðŸ˜‰

> This project is a **fork of [mertpalaoglu1's original version](https://github.com/mertpalaoglu1/emergency_button)** â€” thanks for the idea and base code!

1. **Open your terminal**
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd "your-folder-path"
   ```
3. Start the script:
   ```bash
   python emergency_button.py
   ```
4. Hide the terminal window.
5. **Go wild.**

*(The terminal will keep running in the background while the hotkey listener stays active.)*
